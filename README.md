While this project was focused on working with the database using SQLite3,
I tried to minimize sql queries and tried to utilize nested dictionaries as
I haven't utilized dictionaries as much as I should have.
Even though that made coding a bit harder in some instances, I think it was a
good learning experience for me.

Advantage for using dictionaries over sql queries might be reduced traffic,
but also you have to careful about the data integrity too when working with
and manipulating the lists.

I tried to focus on input data validation and spent quite a bit of time working
on it, but I still can't guarantee that it's completely fool proof. I might need
more rigorous testing if time is given
